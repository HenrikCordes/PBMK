# PBMK
Physiologically-based metabolite kinetic models

We used the popular [Open-Systems-Pharmacology tool](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim) (PK-Sim) in combination with 1) experimental metabolite concentrations data in physiological compartments (blood  plasma, urine, feces) and 2) physicochemical compound parameters from the [human metabolome data base](https://hmdb.ca) (HMDB) to establish an array of endogenous physiologically-based metabolite kinetic (PBMK) models.
