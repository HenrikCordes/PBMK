# PBMK
Physiologically-based metabolite kinetic models

We used the popular PBPK modeling appraoch (PK-Sim) in combination with 1) experimental metabolite concentrations data in physiological compartments (blood  plasma, urine, feces) and 2) physicochemical compound parameters from the human metabolome data base (HMDB; https://hmdb.ca) to establish an array of endogenous physiologically-based metabolite kinetic (PBMK) models.
